# Wish.com
## Introduction
Welcome to my solution for the Wish.com Product Recommendation Challenge! This competition, hosted on Kaggle, aims to predict the likelihood of a user purchasing a product based on various features such as user demographics, product attributes, and historical interactions.

## Dataset
The dataset provided for this competition includes the following files:

* train.csv: This file contains the training data, including user-product interactions and target labels indicating whether the user purchased the product or not.
* test.csv: This file contains the test data, which includes user-product pairs for which predictions need to be made.

## Data Exploration
Before building predictive models, it's essential to understand the characteristics of the dataset. Some key aspects of data exploration include:

Analyzing the distribution of the target variable (purchase/no purchase).
Exploring relationships between user demographics, product attributes, and purchase behavior.
Handling missing values and outliers appropriately.
Visualizing the data to identify patterns and correlations.
Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is crucial for improving model performance. Some feature engineering techniques I applied include:

Creating new features based on user behavior or product attributes.
Encoding categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding or target encoding.
Handling missing values through imputation or other strategies.
Scaling or normalizing numerical features if necessary.
Model Selection
For this binary classification task, I experimented with various machine learning algorithms, including:

```
Naive Bayes
Decision Tree 
SVM
```
I evaluated each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Hyperparameter tuning was performed using techniques like grid search or random search to optimize model performance.

## Model Evaluation
To evaluate the final model, I used techniques like cross-validation on the training data and assessed performance on a held-out validation set. Additionally, I considered the model's performance on the Kaggle leaderboard using the test set.

## Results
After training and fine-tuning the model, here are the results I achieved:

Accuracy on the validation set: 92%

## Conclusion
Participating in this competition provided valuable insights into building recommendation systems and handling large-scale datasets. The experience gained from this challenge helped me enhance my skills in data analysis and machine learning.
